Sorry Mac users.. I don't have a version for you :(

If you are a Mac user you need to work a little bit :)

First, go to "source-code" folder and open it in terminal.

Second, excute this command : "pyinstaller convert.py --onefile".

Finally, a folder called "dist" should be created in the same folder contains the excutable.

Notice: you should install the needed libraries by excuting this command : "pip3 install (name of library)"
The needed libraries : Pillow, lxml, os, bs4, re, pyinstaller
you should already have python :)
